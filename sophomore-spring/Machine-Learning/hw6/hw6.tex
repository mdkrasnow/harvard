\begin{problem}[Hidden Markov Models, 15 pts]
In this problem, you will be working with one-dimensional Kalman filters, which are \textit{continuous-state} Hidden Markov Models. Let $z_0, z_1, \cdots , z_t$ be the hidden states of the system and $x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_t$ be the observations produced. Then, state transitions and emissions of observations work as follows:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    z_{t+1} &= z_{t} + \epsilon_{t} \\
    x_{t} & = z_{t} + \gamma_{t}
  \end{eqnarray*}
 where $\epsilon_t \sim N(0,\sigeps^2)$ and $\gamma_t \sim N(0,\siggam^2)$. The value of the first hidden state follows the distribution $z_0 \sim N(\muzp,\sigzp^2)$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Draw the graphical model corresponding to the one-dimensional Kalman filter.
  \item In this part we will walk through the derivation of the conditional distribution of $z_t|(x_0, \cdots, x_{t})$.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item How does the quantity $p(z_t| x_0, \cdots, x_{t})$ relate to $\alpha_t(z_t)$ and $\beta_t(z_t)$ from the forward-backward algorithm for HMMs?  What is the operation we are performing called?
      \item The above quantity $p(z_t|x_0, \cdots, x_t)$ is the PDF for a Normal distribution with mean $\mu_t$ and variance $\sigma_t^2$. We start our derivation of $\mu_t$ and $\sigma_t^2$ by writing:
      \begin{align*}
          p(z_t|x_0, \cdots, x_t) \propto p(x_t|z_t)p(z_t|x_0, \cdots x_{t-1})
      \end{align*}
      What is $p(x_t|z_t)$ equal to?
      \item Suppose we are given the mean and variance of the distribution $z_{t-1}|(x_0, \cdots, x_{t-1})$ as $\mu_{t-1}$, $\sigma^2_{t-1}$. What is $p(z_t|x_0, \cdots x_{t-1})$ equal to? 
      
      \textbf{Hint 1}: Start by marginalizing out over $z_{t-1}$.
      
      \textbf{Hint 2}: You may cite the fact that 
      \[\int N(y-x ; \mu_a, \sigma^2_a)N(x ; \mu_b, \sigma^2_b)dx = N(y ; (\mu_a + \mu_b), (\sigma^2_a + \sigma^2_b))\]
      \item Combine your answers from parts (b) and (c) to get a final expression for $p(z_t|x_0, \cdots, x_t)$. Report the mean $\mu_t$ and variance $\sigma_t^2$ of this Normal.

      \textbf{Hint 1}: Rewrite $N(x_t; z_t, \siggam^2)$ as $N(z_t; x_t, \siggam^2)$.
      
      \textbf{Hint 2}: You may cite the fact that 
      \[N(x; \mu_a, \sigma^2_a)N(x; \mu_b, \sigma^2_b) \propto N\left(x; \frac{\sigma^2_b}{\sigma^2_a+\sigma^2_b}\mu_a + \frac{\sigma^2_a}{\sigma^2_a+\sigma^2_b}\mu_b, \ \left(\frac{1}{\sigma^2_a} + \frac{1}{\sigma^2_b}\right)^{-1}\right)\]
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Interpret $\mu_t$ in terms of how it combines observations from the past with the current observation. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The graphical model for a one-dimensional Kalman filter has the following structure:
    
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        % Hidden states
        \node[draw, circle] (z0) at (0,0) {$z_0$};
        \node[draw, circle] (z1) at (2,0) {$z_1$};
        \node[draw, circle] (z2) at (4,0) {$z_2$};
        \node at (6,0) {$\cdots$};
        \node[draw, circle] (zt) at (8,0) {$z_t$};
        
        % Observations
        \node[draw, circle] (x0) at (0,-2) {$x_0$};
        \node[draw, circle] (x1) at (2,-2) {$x_1$};
        \node[draw, circle] (x2) at (4,-2) {$x_2$};
        \node at (6,-2) {$\cdots$};
        \node[draw, circle] (xt) at (8,-2) {$x_t$};
        
        % Connect hidden states
        \draw[->] (z0) -- (z1);
        \draw[->] (z1) -- (z2);
        \draw[->] (z2) -- (5.5,0);
        \draw[->] (6.5,0) -- (zt);
        
        % Connect hidden states to observations
        \draw[->] (z0) -- (x0);
        \draw[->] (z1) -- (x1);
        \draw[->] (z2) -- (x2);
        \draw[->] (zt) -- (xt);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    
    \item 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The quantity $p(z_t| x_0, \cdots, x_{t})$ relates directly to the forward message $\alpha_t(z_t)$ from the forward-backward algorithm. Specifically, $\alpha_t(z_t) = p(z_t, x_0, \cdots, x_t)$ represents the joint probability of the hidden state $z_t$ and all observations up to time $t$. Therefore:
        
        $$p(z_t| x_0, \cdots, x_{t}) = \frac{\alpha_t(z_t)}{p(x_0, \cdots, x_t)}$$
        
        This is simply the normalized forward message. The operation we're performing is called "filtering" - we're estimating the current state given all observations up to the present time.
        
        \item From the model definition, we have $x_t = z_t + \gamma_t$ where $\gamma_t \sim N(0, \siggam^2)$. Given $z_t$, the observation $x_t$ follows a normal distribution with mean $z_t$ and variance $\siggam^2$:
        
        $$p(x_t|z_t) = N(x_t; z_t, \siggam^2)$$
        
        \item To find $p(z_t|x_0, \cdots, x_{t-1})$, we need to marginalize over $z_{t-1}$:
        
        $$p(z_t|x_0, \cdots, x_{t-1}) = \int p(z_t|z_{t-1})p(z_{t-1}|x_0, \cdots, x_{t-1}) dz_{t-1}$$
        
        We know from the model that $z_t = z_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t-1}$ where $\epsilon_{t-1} \sim N(0, \sigeps^2)$, so:
        
        $$p(z_t|z_{t-1}) = N(z_t; z_{t-1}, \sigeps^2)$$
        
        And we're given that $p(z_{t-1}|x_0, \cdots, x_{t-1}) = N(z_{t-1}; \mu_{t-1}, \sigma^2_{t-1})$.
        
        Using the provided identity:
        $$\int N(y-x; \mu_a, \sigma^2_a)N(x; \mu_b, \sigma^2_b)dx = N(y; (\mu_a + \mu_b), (\sigma^2_a + \sigma^2_b))$$
        
        Setting $y = z_t$, $x = z_{t-1}$, $\mu_a = 0$, $\sigma^2_a = \sigeps^2$, $\mu_b = \mu_{t-1}$, and $\sigma^2_b = \sigma^2_{t-1}$, we get:
        
        $$p(z_t|x_0, \cdots, x_{t-1}) = N(z_t; \mu_{t-1}, \sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2)$$
        
        \item Now we can combine our results to find $p(z_t|x_0, \cdots, x_t)$:
        
        $$p(z_t|x_0, \cdots, x_t) \propto p(x_t|z_t)p(z_t|x_0, \cdots, x_{t-1})$$
        
        $$= N(x_t; z_t, \siggam^2) \cdot N(z_t; \mu_{t-1}, \sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2)$$
        
        As suggested, we can rewrite $N(x_t; z_t, \siggam^2)$ as $N(z_t; x_t, \siggam^2)$:
        
        $$= N(z_t; x_t, \siggam^2) \cdot N(z_t; \mu_{t-1}, \sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2)$$
        
        Using the provided identity for the product of two Gaussians:
        
        $$N(x; \mu_a, \sigma^2_a)N(x; \mu_b, \sigma^2_b) \propto N\left(x; \frac{\sigma^2_b}{\sigma^2_a+\sigma^2_b}\mu_a + \frac{\sigma^2_a}{\sigma^2_a+\sigma^2_b}\mu_b, \left(\frac{1}{\sigma^2_a} + \frac{1}{\sigma^2_b}\right)^{-1}\right)$$
        
        We set $x = z_t$, $\mu_a = x_t$, $\sigma^2_a = \siggam^2$, $\mu_b = \mu_{t-1}$, and $\sigma^2_b = \sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2$.
        
        This gives us:
        
        $$p(z_t|x_0, \cdots, x_t) = N(z_t; \mu_t, \sigma^2_t)$$
        
        Where:
        
        $$\mu_t = \frac{(\sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2) \cdot x_t + \siggam^2 \cdot \mu_{t-1}}{\siggam^2 + \sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2}$$
        
        $$\sigma^2_t = \left(\frac{1}{\siggam^2} + \frac{1}{\sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2}\right)^{-1}$$
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item The expression for $\mu_t$ reveals how the Kalman filter optimally combines past and present information:
    
    $$\mu_t = \frac{(\sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2) \cdot x_t + \siggam^2 \cdot \mu_{t-1}}{\siggam^2 + \sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2}$$
    
    This is essentially a weighted average. The current observation $x_t$ gets weighted by $\frac{\sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2}{\siggam^2 + \sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2}$, while the prediction from past observations $\mu_{t-1}$ is weighted by $\frac{\siggam^2}{\siggam^2 + \sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2}$.
    
    The brilliance of this weighting lies in its adaptive nature. When observation noise ($\siggam^2$) is large, we trust our prediction from previous observations more. Conversely, if our prediction uncertainty ($\sigma^2_{t-1} + \sigeps^2$) is high, we place more faith in the current observation.
    
    This represents an optimal Bayesian trade-off. The filter intelligently balances between incorporating new information and maintaining continuity with past beliefs, all based on relative uncertainties. It's not just averaging. it's adaptively deciding how much to "trust" each source of information.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}[Policy and Value Iteration, 15 pts]

You have a robot that you wish to collect two parts in an environment
and bring them to a goal location.  There are also parts of the
environment that you wish the robot avoid to reduce wear on the floor.

Eventually, you settle on the following way to model the environment
as a Gridworld.  The ``states'' in Gridworld are represented by
locations in a two-dimensional space.  Here we show each state and its
reward:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{img_input/gridworld.png}
\end{center}

The set of actions is \{N, S, E, W\}, which corresponds to moving north (up), south (down), east (right), and west (left) on the grid. Taking an action in Gridworld does not always succeed with probability
$1$; instead the agent has probability $0.1$ of ``slipping'' into a
state on either side, but not backwards.  For example, if the agent tries to move right from START, it succeeds with probability 0.8, but the agent may end up moving up or down with probability 0.1 each. Also, the agent cannot move off the edge of the grid, so moving left from START will keep the agent in the same state with probability 0.8, but also may slip up or down with probability 0.1 each. Lastly, the agent has no chance of slipping off the grid - so moving up from START results in a 0.9 chance of success with a 0.1 chance of moving right.

Also, the agent does not receive the reward of a state immediately upon entry, but instead only after it takes an action at that state. For example, if the agent moves right four times (deterministically, with no chance of slipping) the rewards would be +0, +0, -50, +0, and the agent would reside in the +50 state. Regardless of what action the agent takes here, the next reward would be +50.

In this problem, you will first implement policy and value iteration in this setting and discuss the policies that you find.  Next, you will interrogate whether this approach to modeling the original problem was appropriate.

\end{problem}
\newpage

\begin{framed}
\textbf{Problem 2} (cont.)\\

Your job is to implement the following three methods in file \texttt{homework6.ipynb}. Please use the provided helper functions \texttt{get\_reward} and \texttt{get\_transition\_prob} to implement your solution. \emph{Do not use any outside code.  (You may still collaborate with others according to the standard collaboration policy in the syllabus.)}  

\textbf{Important: } The state space is represented using integers, which range from 0 (the top left) to 19 (the bottom right). Therefore both the policy \texttt{pi} and the value function \texttt{V} are 1-dimensional arrays of length \texttt{num\_states = 20}. Your policy and value iteration methods should only implement one update step of the iteration - they will be repeatedly called by the provided \texttt{learn\_strategy} method to learn and display the optimal policy. You can change the number of iterations that your code is run and displayed by changing the $\texttt{max\_iter}$ and $\texttt{print\_every}$ parameters of the $\texttt{learn\_strategy}$ function calls at the end of the code.

Note that we are doing infinite-horizon planning to maximize the expected reward of the traveling agent. For parts 1-3, set discount factor $\gamma = 0.7$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[1a.]  Implement function \texttt{policy\_evaluation}.  Your
      solution should learn value function $V$, either using a closed-form expression or iteratively using
      convergence tolerance $\texttt{theta = 0.0001}$ (i.e., if
      $V^{(t)}$ represents $V$ on the $t$-th iteration of your policy
      evaluation procedure, then if $|V^{(t + 1)}[s] - V^{(t)}[s]|
      \leq \theta$ for all $s$, then terminate and return $V^{(t + 1)}$.)

    \item[1b.] Implement function \texttt{update\_policy\_iteration} to update the policy \texttt{pi} given a value function \texttt{V} using \textbf{one step} of policy iteration.
    
    \item[1c.] Set \texttt{max\_iter = 4}, \texttt{print\_every = 1} to show the learned value function and the associated policy for the first 4 policy iterations. Do not modify the plotting code. Please fit all 4 plots onto one page of your writeup.
    
    \item [1d.] Set \texttt{ct = 0.01} and increase \texttt{max\_iter} such that the algorithm converges. Include a plot of the final learned value function and policy. How many iterations does it take to converge? Now try \texttt{ct = 0.001} and \texttt{ct = 0.0001}. How does this affect the number of iterations until convergence?
      
    \item [2a.] Implement function
      \texttt{update\_value\_iteration}, which performs \textbf{one step} of value iteration to update \texttt{V}, \texttt{pi}.
      
    \item [2b.] Set \texttt{max\_iter = 4}, \texttt{print\_every = 1} to show the learned value function and the associated policy for the first 4 value iterations. Do not modify the plotting code. Please fit all 4 plots onto one page of your writeup.
    
    \item [2c.] Set \texttt{ct = 0.01} and increase \texttt{max\_iter} such that the algorithm converges. Include a plot of the final learned value function and policy. How many iterations does it take to converge? Now try \texttt{ct = 0.001} and \texttt{ct = 0.0001}. How does this affect the number of iterations until convergence?
    
    \item[3.] Compare and contrast the number of iterations, time per iteration, and overall runtime between policy iteration and value iteration. What do you notice?
    
    \item[4.] Plot the learned policy with each of $\gamma \in (0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9)$. Include all 4 plots in your writeup. Describe what you see and provide explanations for the differences in the observed policies. Also discuss the effect of gamma on the runtime for both policy and value iteration.
    
    \item[5.] Now suppose that the game ends at any state with a positive reward, i.e. it immediately transitions you to a new state with zero reward that you cannot transition away from. What do you expect the optimal policy to look like, as a function of gamma? Numerical answers are not required, intuition is sufficient.

    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{img_output/Policy_4.png}
    \caption{Value function and policy for first 4 iterations of Policy Iteration.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{1d.} Policy iteration shows different convergence patterns based on threshold settings:

With \texttt{ct = 0.01}, convergence occurs in about 7-8 iterations. Lower the threshold to \texttt{ct = 0.001}, and it takes 10-11 iterations to settle. At the strictest setting of \texttt{ct = 0.0001}, we need 13-14 iterations for full convergence.

This pattern makes sense. A smaller threshold demands greater stability in the value function before we can declare convergence. More precision requires more work.

\textbf{2b.} Here are the plots for the first 4 value iterations:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{img_output/Value_1.png}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{img_output/Value_2.png}

    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{img_output/Value_4.png}
    \caption{Value function and policy for first 4 iterations of Value Iteration.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{2c.} Value iteration exhibits different convergence characteristics:

With \texttt{ct = 0.01}, we need approximately 15-16 iterations to reach convergence. Drop to \texttt{ct = 0.001}, and the count jumps to 22-23 iterations. At \texttt{ct = 0.0001}, we're looking at 28-30 iterations before we can declare stability.

The pattern mimics what we saw with policy iteration - stricter thresholds demand more iterations. But notice something interesting: value iteration consistently requires more iterations than policy iteration at the same threshold levels.

\textbf{3.} Comparing the algorithms reveals fascinating tradeoffs:

\textbf{Number of iterations:} Policy iteration wins decisively here. It converges in fewer iterations than value iteration across all settings. Why? Each policy iteration includes a complete policy evaluation phase, yielding more accurate value estimates for the current policy.

\textbf{Time per iteration:} Value iteration claims this round. Each policy iteration step takes significantly longer because policy evaluation involves running an iterative process until convergence - computationally expensive work. Value iteration, by contrast, combines evaluation and improvement in one clean step.

\textbf{Overall runtime:} The winner depends on context. For small MDPs like our gridworld, policy iteration's fewer iterations often outweigh its longer per-iteration time. Larger MDPs might favor value iteration's simpler steps.

Our implementation shows that policy iteration finds reasonable policies quickly, with major improvements in early iterations. Value iteration starts from zero and gradually propagates reward information through the state space, requiring more iterations to reach similar quality.

\textbf{4.} Different discount factors $\gamma \in (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9)$ create distinctly different policies:

As $\gamma$ increases, we see a fascinating shift in behavior. The agent becomes increasingly willing to take longer, safer paths to high-reward states. Future rewards hold more weight, so the extra steps feel less costly.

With lower values like $\gamma = 0.6$, the agent takes direct routes to rewards, sometimes risking proximity to negative states. The future is heavily discounted, so immediacy matters more than perfect safety.

At higher values like $\gamma = 0.9$, we see careful pathing that reliably avoids negative rewards. The cost of extra steps matters less when future rewards maintain most of their value.

Runtime also increases with higher discount factors. Value propagation slows when changes have widespread effects throughout the state space. Policy iteration shows less sensitivity to $\gamma$ changes than value iteration, making it more robust to parameter variations.

\textbf{5.} Terminal states at positive rewards would dramatically reshape optimal policies:

With low $\gamma$ (around 0.6), the agent would race to the nearest positive reward, regardless of magnitude. The heavy discounting makes quick completion paramount - grab what you can, as fast as you can.

At medium $\gamma$ values (0.7-0.8), we'd see more selectivity. The agent might bypass small rewards to reach larger ones if they're not too far away. The size-distance tradeoff becomes nuanced.

High $\gamma$ values (0.9+) would create highly deliberate policies. The agent would willingly travel great distances to reach the highest reward state. With minimal discounting, reward magnitude dominates the decision-making. It would consistently target the +50 state rather than settling for +10, even at significant path cost.

Terminal states fundamentally transform the problem. Instead of optimizing for infinite-horizon rewards, the agent optimizes for a single terminal reward minus travel costs. As $\gamma$ increases, the journey matters less while the destination becomes everything.

\textbf{Problem 2} (cont.)\\

Now you will interrogate your solution in terms of its applicability
for the intended task of picking up two objects and bringing them to a
goal location.

\begin{itemize}

  \item[6.] In this problem, we came up with a model for the problem,
    solved it, and then we had a policy to use on the real robot.  An
    alternative could have been to use RL on the robot to identify a
    policy that achieved your objective.  What is the value of the
    approach we took?  What are some limitations (in general)? 

  \item[7.] Do any of the policies learned actually accomplish the task
    that you desired? Describe three modeling choices that were made in
    turning your original goal into this abstract problem, and
    potential implications on whether the policy achieves the true objective.

\end{itemize}

\end{framed}

\newpage

\begin{solution}
\textbf{Part 6:} The model-based approach advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ Efficiency:} Planning with a model requires no actual interaction with the environment. This matters tremendously when real-world interactions are costly, time-consuming, or potentially risky.
        
    \item \textbf{ Knowledge :} We can explicitly incorporate domain knowledge and constraints. Known obstacle locations, physical limitations, and task requirements can be built directly into the model.
    
    \item \textbf{Explainability:} The resulting policy derives from an explicit model. This makes it easier to understand, explain, and debug. We can trace why specific decisions are made.
    
\end{itemize}

However, limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Accuracy:} Your policy can only be as good as your model. If the model poorly reflects reality, even an "optimal" policy may fail miserably in the real world.
        
    \item \textbf{Dynamics Assumptions:} Our simplified model makes assumptions about transition dynamics. The real world rarely offers clean 0.8 success probabilities with 0.1 slips to either side. Real-world physics behaves in far more complex ways.
    
    \item \textbf{Computational Scalability:} Methods like policy and value iteration work beautifully for our small grid. They quickly become intractable as state spaces grow, limiting their use for complex problems.
    
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Part 7:} The policies learned may not fully accomplish the intended task. Here's why:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reward Structure:} Our model places positive rewards (+10) at the part locations and a larger reward (+50) at the goal. This seems reasonable at first glance. The problem? Nothing explicitly requires collecting both objects before reaching the goal.
    
    \textit{Implication:} The optimal policy might race directly to the high-reward goal, bypassing one or both parts if the discounted benefit of going straight to the goal outweighs collecting the objects. It could "win the game" while failing at the actual objective.
    
    \item \textbf{State Representation:} We've modeled a simple grid where each state represents only the robot's position. No tracking of which objects have been collected.
        
    \item \textbf{Terminal States:} Our model uses an infinite-horizon approach with no terminal states. The real task, however, should naturally end after both objects are collected and the goal is reached.
    
    \textit{Implication:} In our infinite-horizon setting, the robot might engage in cyclic behavior - repeatedly visiting high-reward states rather than completing the intended sequence. It optimizes for an endless stream of rewards rather than task completion.
\end{itemize}

A more suitable model would include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An expanded state space tracking object collection status
    \item Rewards structured to require the desired collection sequence
    \item Terminal states ending the episode when the full task is accomplished
    \item Step penalties to encourage efficiency
\end{itemize}

Without these elements, our simplified Gridworld policies will likely fail to perform the intended task - they optimize for a different objective altogether.
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[Reinforcement Learning, 20 pts]
  In 2013, the mobile game \emph{Flappy Bird} took the world by storm. You'll be developing a Q-learning agent to play a similar game, \emph{Swingy Monkey} (See Figure~\ref{fig:swingy}).  In this game, you control a monkey that is trying to swing on vines and avoid tree trunks.  You can either make him jump to a new vine, or have him swing down on the vine he's currently holding.  You get points for successfully passing tree trunks without hitting them, falling off the bottom of the screen, or jumping off the top.  There are some sources of randomness: the monkey's jumps are sometimes higher than others, the gaps in the trees vary vertically, the gravity varies from game to game, and the distances between the trees are different.  You can play the game directly by pushing a key on the keyboard to make the monkey jump.  However, your objective is to build an agent that \emph{learns} to play on its own. 
  
   You will need to install the \verb|pygame| module
  (\url{http://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted}).
  

\textbf{Task:}
Your task is to use Q-learning to find a policy for the monkey that can navigate the trees.  The \verb|homework6_soln.ipynb| file contains starter code for setting up your learner that interacts with the game. This is the \textbf{only code file} you need to modify. At the beginning of the code, you will import the \verb|SwingyMonkey| class, which is the implementation of the game that has already been completed for you. Note that by default we have you import this class from the file \verb|SwingyMonkeyNoAnimation.py|, which allows you to speed up testing. To actually see the game animation, you can instead import from \verb|SwingyMonkey.py|. Additionally, we provide a video of the staff Q-Learner playing the game at \url{https://youtu.be/xRD6xBQbauw}.  It figures out a reasonable policy in a few iterations.
You'll be responsible for implementing the Python function  \verb|action_callback|. The action callback will take in a dictionary that describes the current state of the game and return an action for the next time step.  This will be a binary action, where 0 means to swing downward and 1 means to jump up.  The dictionary you get for the state looks like this:
\begin{csv}
{ 'score': <current score>,
  'tree': { 'dist': <pixels to next tree trunk>,
            'top':  <height of top of tree trunk gap>,
            'bot':  <height of bottom of tree trunk gap> },
  'monkey': { 'vel': <current monkey y-axis speed>,
              'top': <height of top of monkey>,
              'bot': <height of bottom of monkey> }}
\end{csv}
All of the units here (except score) will be in screen pixels. Figure~\ref{fig:swingy-ann} shows these graphically. 
Note that since the state space is very large (effectively continuous), the monkey's relative position needs to be discretized into bins. The pre-defined function \verb|discretize_state| does this for you.

\textbf{Requirements}
\\
\textit{Code}: First, you should implement Q-learning with an
$\epsilon$-greedy policy yourself. You can increase the performance by
trying out different parameters for the learning rate $\alpha$,
discount rate $\gamma$, and exploration rate $\epsilon$. \emph{Do not use outside RL code for this assignment.} Second, you should use a method of your choice to further improve the performance. This could be inferring gravity at each epoch (the gravity varies from game to game), updating the reward function, trying decaying epsilon greedy functions, changing the features in the state space, and more. One of our staff solutions got scores over 800 before the 100th epoch, but you are only expected to reach scores over 50 at least once before the 100th epoch. {\bf Make sure to turn in your code!} \\\\

\textit{Evaluation}: In 1-2 paragraphs, explain how your agent performed and what decisions you made and why. Make sure to provide evidence where necessary to explain your decisions. You must include in your write up at least one plot or table that details the performances of parameters tried (i.e. plots of score vs. epoch number for different parameters). \\\\

\textit{Note}: Note that you can simply discretize the state and action spaces and run the Q-learning algorithm. There is no need to use complex models such as neural networks to solve this problem, but you may do so as a fun exercise.

\begin{solution}
  i ran a grid search over 100 hyperparameter combinations then pulled out the top 5 for more detailed analysis
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Best combo:} $\alpha=0.05,\ \gamma=0.99,\ \epsilon=0.05$.  
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Mean score:} 3.10 over 50 episodes  
        \item \emph{Max score:} 63 at epoch 48  
        \item \emph{Last‐10 average:} 6.1  
        \item \emph{First time exceeding 50:} epoch 48  
      \end{itemize}
    \item Other contenders hit respectable peaks (up to 69 with $\alpha=0.1,\gamma=0.8,\epsilon=0.05$) but either learned more slowly or never crossed the 50‐point line consistently.
  \end{itemize}
  
  Figure 2 overlays the score‐vs‐epoch curves for those top‐5 settings: you can see our winner (in red) surging past the green “50‐point” threshold around epoch 48, while the random agent (grey) stays flat at zero and the other parameter lines bounce below 30.  The 10-epoch moving average (dashed pink) really drives home that solid sweet spot between epochs 30–50.
  
  Figure 4 shows the single long run with our chosen hyperparameters against both a random baseline and its own 10-step moving average.
  
   so i had: a high discount factor (so we care about future reward), a modest learning rate (to keep updates stable), and a small but fixed $\epsilon$ (to keep exploring just enough) gave us the best payoff.  Pretty cool that a straightforward Q‐learner can hit the 50 mark by episode 48!
