    "The assignment is divided into 8 main questions, each building upon the previous ones, followed by a wrap-up:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fetching HTML from screenboston.com (10 pts)\n",
    "2. Parsing HTML into structured data (15 pts)\n",
    "3. Augmenting data with historical snapshots (15 pts)\n",
    "4. Creating and manipulating a Pandas DataFrame (15 pts)\n",
    "5. Initial exploratory data analysis and visualization (15 pts)\n",
    "6. Finding Wikipedia pages for each screened film (7 pts)\n",
    "7. Storing Wikipedia HTML in the DataFrame (3 pts)\n",
    "8. Extracting and analyzing data from Wikipedia pages (15 pts)\n",
    "9. Wrap-up (5 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress through these steps, you'll be transforming raw web data into a rich dataset ready for analysis. By the end, you'll have created a comprehensive overview of Boston's movie screening landscape, potentially uncovering interesting trends and patterns in the process. "

    "- Plots should be legible and interpretable *without having to refer to the code that generated them*. They should include labels for the $x$- and $y$-axes as well as a descriptive title and/or legend when appropriate.\n",
    "- When asked to interpret a visualization, do not simply describe it (e.g., \"the curve has a steep slope up\"), but instead explain what you believe the plot *means*.\n",
    "- Autograding tests are mostly to help you debug. The tests are not exhaustive so simply passing all tests may not be sufficient for full credit.\n",
    "- The use of *extremely* inefficient or error-prone code (e.g., copy-pasting nearly identical commands rather than looping) may result in only partial credit.\n",
    "- We have tried to include all the libraries you may need to do the assignment in the imports cell provided below. Please get course staff approval before importing any additional 3rd party libraries.\n",
    "- Enable scrolling output on cells with very long output. Or better yet, avoid overly long output altogether.\n",
    "- Feel free to add additional code or markdown cells as needed.\n",
    "- Don't forget to include a written response when one is requested by a question prompt.\n",
    "- Ensure your code runs top to bottom without error and passes all tests by restarting the kernel and running all cells (note that this can take a few minutes). \n",

Shoot for at least 50%.\n",

    "- Feel free to explore wikipedia's API options as an alternative using the search URL.\n",
    "- Depending on your implementation, this process could take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. To avoid unnecessary requests (and waiting) you should once again write your results to a file and only make requests if this file does not already exist. This point won't be repeated any more in this assignment but you should follow this principle whenever possible to avoid repeating any long tasks or computations.\n",
    "- Most of the time taken by a request is spend waiting for a response. Asynchronous requests allow you to initiate new requests without having to wait for the previous one to be returned. You can explore the asyncio and aiohttp libraries (imported above) if you'd like to optimize your code for speed. Just be warned that these are very deep topics in themselves so this should really just be an optimization step for the curious. To complicate matters, asyncio works slightly differently in Jupyter notebooks than in Python scripts. Finally, making too many requests too quickly can cause some to fail or may even result in your IP being temporarily blocked by a server.\n",
