    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will construct and evaluate classification models to predict student outcomes (‚ÄúDropout,‚Äù ‚ÄúEnrolled,‚Äù or ‚ÄúGraduate‚Äù) using demographic, socio-economic, and academic data available at the point of enrollment. The aim is to identify students at risk and understand the factors contributing to their academic outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this assignment originates from the Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre, Portugal, and includes information such as demographics, socio-economic background, and academic history at the time of enrollment. The classification task involves predicting whether a student will graduate, remain enrolled, or drop out, which poses unique challenges, including class imbalance.\n",

    "More information on the dataset and related modeling approaches can be found in the paper \"Early Prediction of Student‚Äôs Performance in Higher Education: A Case Study\" by Martins et al.. We have included a PDF of this paper in the data directory for your reference."
