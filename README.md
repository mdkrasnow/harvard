# Matt Krasnow's College Work

This repository contains course materials, projects, and assignments from my undergraduate studies at Harvard University. It serves as a personal archive of my academic work and projects across multiple semesters and courses.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by academic terms:

- `sophomore-fall/`: Materials from fall semester
- `sophomore-spring/`: Materials from spring semester
- `textbooks/`: Collection of course textbooks and reference materials

## Sophomore Spring Courses

### Machine Learning (CS 181)
Programming assignments and projects focused on fundamental machine learning concepts, algorithms, and their applications. Includes Jupyter notebooks, LaTeX documents, and implementation code.

### Real Analysis
Mathematical proofs and problem sets exploring concepts in real analysis. Homework assignments concentrate on rigorous mathematical theory and proofs.

### Program Evaluation (A164)
Course focused on methodologies for evaluating educational programs and policies. Includes problem sets and analytical assignments.

### Prediction Projects
Code for predictive analytics projects, including Reddit AI model analysis scripts and data processing tools.

## Sophomore Fall Courses

### Linear Models
Coursework covering statistical linear models, regression analysis, and related mathematical concepts. Includes homework assignments and a final project.

### Data Science (CS 109a)
Projects and assignments focused on data science methodologies, including data analysis, visualization, and implementation of various algorithms.

### Sociolinguistics
Study of the relationship between language and society, including coursework on language variation and change.

## Reference Materials

The `textbooks/` directory contains essential academic resources, including:
- CS 181 Machine Learning textbook
- Rudin's Analysis
- Linear Algebra references
- Statistics textbooks
- Book of Proof
- And other mathematical foundations texts

## Note

This repository primarily serves as a personal archive and reference collection. Some content may be subject to academic policies from Harvard University.
